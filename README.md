## ˚₊‧꒰ა About Me ໒꒱ ‧₊˚

I enjoy creating innovative web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve real-world or fun task problems. Currently, I’m pursuing a career in Software Development, aiming to build user-friendly applications that make a positive impact. I express my creativity through digital art and writing in my spare time.

- **Women in Tech Website:** A project highlighting women in technology, featuring profiles and resources.
I developed a website to celebrate women's contributions in the technology field. The site features profiles, resources, and articles designed to empower and inspire women in tech. Although the website is currently unavailable for viewing due to restrictions, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and informative user experience. This project helped me enhance my web development skills and deepened my understanding of the importance of representation in the tech industry.

- **JavaScript Project (Khan Academy):**
Currently working on an online course titled "Computer Programming - JavaScript and the Web" as part of my learning journey with Khan Academy. This project allows me to apply and deepen my understanding of JavaScript concepts, enhancing my programming skills. **[View Project](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_123366395341261238575054/projects)**
