# Welcome to My Portfolio °❀⋆.ೃ࿔*:･
Hi, I'm Bianca Jimmy, a web developer and digital artist. Explore my work and feel free to reach out for collaborations or opportunities!

## ˚₊‧꒰ა About Me ໒꒱ ‧₊˚
I am a passionate and aspiring web developer with completed BTEC Level 3 qualifications in Business Studies and Computer Science. I enjoy creating innovative web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to solve real-world or fun task problems. Currently, I’m pursuing a career in Software Development, aiming to build user-friendly applications that make a positive impact. I express my creativity through digital art and writing in my spare time.
I look forward to connecting and collaborating on exciting projects!

## ₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧ Projects ₊˚.⋆☾⋆⁺₊✧
Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on:

- **Recipe Website:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is just a mock website that I created as part of a task to create a recipe website. For my recipe, I decided to create a Mochi website. For context, a Mochi is a Japanese rice cake made of mochigome, a short-grain japonica glutinous rice, and sometimes other ingredients such as water, sugar, and cornstarch.

- **Women in Tech Website:** A project highlighting women in technology, featuring profiles and resources.
I developed a website to celebrate women's contributions in the technology field. The site features profiles, resources, and articles designed to empower and inspire women in tech. Although the website is currently unavailable for viewing due to restrictions, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and informative user experience. This project helped me enhance my web development skills and deepened my understanding of the importance of representation in the tech industry.

- **JavaScript Project (Khan Academy):**
Currently working on an online course titled "Computer Programming - JavaScript and the Web" as part of my learning journey with Khan Academy. This project allows me to apply and deepen my understanding of JavaScript concepts, enhancing my programming skills.
